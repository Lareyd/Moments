## Painting in 3D Space
"Painting in 3D Space" is available on Unity Asset Store. As in reality, chooses an origin, it will paint images(such as a logo) in the 3D world. Supports both flat surface and curved surface. When painting targets move, the painted images would move with them identically(translate, rotate, scale).
